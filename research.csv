Tracing cell lineages and studying human development;<p>Tracing cell ancestries (i.e., lineages) is fundamental to understanding the principles of development in multicellular organisms and unraveling complex biological processes involving the differentiation of diverse cell types with distinct lineage hierarchies. In humans, direct experimental lineage tracing is not ethically feasible, so researchers must rely on naturally occurring mutations that arise as cells divide and age. Our group has shown that it is possible to reconstruct lineages in normal, noncancerous human cells using natural variations in both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA, drawing on diverse types of genomic data. We are particularly focused on studying cell ancestries ancestry during the earliest stages of human development, including germline lineage tracing across generations. Our work had shed light on how early pre-gastrulation lineages are transmitted and contribute to the ongoing evolution of the human genome. With advances in genomic technologies and analytical methods, the scientific community is approaching a major milestone: the construction of a comprehensive, high-resolution map of human embryonic and fetal cell lineages. We are committed to contributing to this transformative effort including contribution to the SMaHT project.</p>;lineage2.png
Single cell studies;<p>Single-cell sequencing is a powerful approach for studying somatic mosaicism in both healthy tissues and cancer. However, because a single cell contains only a limited amount of DNA, amplification is necessary prior to sequencing. This can be achieved through clonal expansion—culturing a single cell to form a colony—or through in vitro whole-genome amplification (WGA) using polymerases. We are currently developing strategies to ensure the quality control of WGA and to distinguish true biological signal from artifacts introduced during cell culture or DNA amplification. In parallel, we are designing methods to estimate the respective contributions of signal and noise in cases where they cannot be clearly separated.</p>;singlecell4.png
Cancer genomics;<p>During the past decade, high-throughput next-generation technologies coupled with computational algorithms have enabled us to better understand the biology of cancer as well as the molecular underpinnings of its development and progression. Numerous functionally significant point mutations as well as structural alterations have been identified in several types and subtypes of cancers that illustrate the diverse landscape of the cancer genome. In our laboratory, we focus on the discovery and analysis of somatic point mutations and structural alterations, including deletions, duplications, and copy number changes, in colon cancer and glioma. We are especially interested in understanding the relationship between patterns of genetic alterations and modes of evolution of cancer, as well as molecular differences between cancer-free and cancer-adjacent polyps.</p>;polyp2.png
CNV and CNA analysis;<p>Copy number variation (CNV) in the genome is a complex phenomenon that remains incompletely understood. Frequent in cancers, somatic copy number alterations (CNA) have been related to cancer susceptibility, cancer progression and invasiveness, individual response to the treatment, and patients’ quality of life after treatment. The detection of CNVs and CNAs is important to address a wide spectrum of clinical and scientific questions. Research in our laboratory is focused on the discovery and analysis of CNVs and CNAs along with their relevance to diseases. We have developed and continually improved a method, CNVnator/CNVpytor, for CNV discovery and genotyping from a read-depth analysis of personal genome or cancer sequencing that currently ranks among the best, most widely used methods for CNV analysis.</p>;cnvpytor2.jpg
Variant function;<p>Advances in transcriptomic and epigenomic profiling techniques, including single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq, provide powerful opportunities to study the consequences of genomic variants—both inherited and somatic—particularly in non-coding regions of the genome where their effects remain poorly understood. Our laboratory is focused on elucidating such effects, with an emphasis on variants that contribute to neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder and Tourette syndrome (TS). Recently, leveraging single-nucleus transcriptomic and open chromatin datasets from the postmortem striatum of adult TS patients and matched controls, we analyzed gene expression and chromatin accessibility across defined cell types. These analyses revealed a reduction in GABAergic and cholinergic interneurons in TS brains. Additional findings suggest that interneuron loss leads to chronic hyperactivity of medium spiny neurons, resulting in metabolic stress, microglial activation, and disruption of basal ganglia homeostasis. Our ongoing work seeks to further define the regulatory landscape of TS using an expanded sample set.</p>;function3.jpg
Mosaic somatic mutations in humans;<p>Mutations that accumulate in DNA throughout an individual’s life give rise to a mosaic body, where each cell carries a unique set of genetic alterations — a phenomenon known as somatic mosaicism. Although somatic mosaicism is widespread, its study has been limited by challenges in detecting such variants, both at the single-cell level and in bulk tissue samples. Our group has developed computational methods to accurately detect somatic mosaic mutations by leveraging deep whole-genome sequencing of human tissue samples. Using this approach, we discovered that in the human brain, certain cells undergo clonal expansion with age, outcompeting their peers and leading to an increased burden of detectable mosaic mutations — a phenomenon we refer to as brain hypermutability. We found that this overgrowth is associated with damaging mutations in cancer driver genes. Our ongoing work focuses on uncovering the origin of this phenomenon and identifying the specific cell type(s) responsible for the clonal expansion.</p>;mosaic3.jpg
