Tracing lineages and studying human development;<p>Tracing cell lineages is fundamental for understanding the rules governing development in multicellular organisms and delineating complex biological processes involving the differentiation of multiple cell types with distinct lineage hierarchies. In humans, experimental lineage tracing is unethical, and one has to rely on natural-mutation markers that are created within cells as they proliferate and age. We have demonstrated that it is now possible to trace lineages in normal, noncancerous cells with a variety of data types using natural variations in the nuclear and mitochondrial DNA. In our lab we are studying lineage ancestry in the earliest stages of human development. It is also apparent that the scientific community is on the verge of being able to make a comprehensive and detailed cell lineage map of human embryonic and fetal development. We intend to contribute to that knowledge.</p>;lineage2.png
Single cell studies;<p>Single-cell sequencing is the ultimate way to study somatic mosaicism in healthy tissues and in cancer. However, due to the scarcity of DNA in a single cell, an amplification process is required. Such amplifications can be achieved via clonal expansion, in which a single cell is cultured to produce a colony, and via in vitro whole genome amplification (WGA), in which DNA is amplified by using polymerases. We are currently formulating strategies for the quality control of WGA and to distinguish signal from noise that may be introduced during cell culture or DNA amplification, as well as developing approaches to estimate the contributions of signal and noise when they cannot be distinguished unambiguously.</p>;singlecell4.png
Cancer genomics;<p>During the past decade, high-throughput next-generation technologies coupled with computational algorithms have enabled us to better understand the biology of cancer as well as the molecular underpinnings of its development and progression. Numerous functionally significant point mutations as well as structural alterations have been identified in several types and subtypes of cancers that illustrate the diverse landscape of the cancer genome. In our laboratory, we focus on the discovery and analysis of somatic point mutations and structural alterations, including deletions, duplications, and copy number changes, in colon cancer and glioma. We are especially interested in understanding the relationship between patterns of genetic alterations and modes of evolution of cancer, as well as molecular differences between cancer-free and cancer-adjacent polyps.</p>;polyp2.png
CNV and CNA analysis;<p>Copy number variation (CNV) in the genome is a complex phenomenon that remains incompletely understood. Frequent in cancers, somatic copy number alterations (CNA) have been related to cancer susceptibility, cancer progression and invasiveness, individual response to the treatment, and patients’ quality of life after treatment. The detection of CNVs and CNAs is important to address a wide spectrum of clinical and scientific questions. Research in our laboratory is focused on the discovery and analysis of CNVs and CNAs along with their relevance to diseases. We have developed and continually improved a method, CNVnator/CNVpytor, for CNV discovery and genotyping from a read-depth analysis of personal genome or cancer sequencing that currently ranks among the best, most widely used methods for CNV analysis.</p>;cnvpytor2.jpg
Variant function;<p>Simultaneous advances in genomics (i.e., in variant discovery), epigenomics, and functional genomics (i.e., emergence of ChiP-seq, ATAC-seq, Hi-C, and RNA-seq techniques) provide opportunities to study both the origins and consequences of genomic variants. We are interested in understanding various epigenomic properties that predispose mutational processes generating single nucleotide variation (SNV) and structural variation (SV). Inversely, germline and somatic variants affect genome function. However, because many of those variants occur in non-coding regions of the genome, their effects remain poorly understood. In response, our laboratory is actively working to elucidate such effects with a particular focus on variants contributing to neuro-developmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorders and Tourette syndrome.</p>;function2.png
Analysis of mosaic somatic mutations in humans;<p>Mutations that accumulate in DNA throughout an individual's life lead to a mosaic body, where each cell harbors a unique set of genetic mutations —- a phenomenon known as somatic mosaicism. Although somatic mosaicism is widespread, its study has long been hindered by the inability to detect such genomic variants at the single-cell level. However, recent advances in single-cell genomics and falling sequencing costs are now making this research feasible. Our group develops computational methods to accurately detect somatic mosaic mutations by leveraging widely adoopted and emerging experimental techniques, including single cell cloning and whole-genome amplification of a cell. By applying these methods to human samples, we aim to address fundamental questions about the origin, propagation, and impact of mosaic mutations. This includes estimating mutation rates, examining how mutation patterns vary across tissues and with age, recostructing personal cellular ancesgries (i.e., cell lineages) and exploring mutation's relevance to disease and aging. Our group contributes to this work as part of the Somatic Mosaicism Across Human Tissues (SMaHT) project.</p>;mosaic3.jpg
