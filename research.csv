Analysis of mosaic variants and cell lineage reconstruction;<p>Mutations in DNA accumulate during lifespan of an individual resulting in mosaic body where each cell has its private variants in the genome. This is called somatic mosaicism. Despite of its commonness, studying somatic mosaicism has been limited by lack of means to detect such variants at single-cell level. Recent advances in single cell genomics make it possible. Our group develops new computational methods for precise detection of somatic mosaic variants harnessing new experimental approaches such Next-gen sequencing. By applying the methods to human samples, we pursue to answer the questions about the origin and etiology of somatic mosaic mutations, which involves determining mutation rates during human development, the difference in numbers and patterns of mutations between tissues and between development stages, the relationships of somatic mutations to disease, aging, and healthy life.</p>;mosaic.png
Single cell studies;"<p>Somatic mutations start accumulating with every cell divisions as early as the zygotic stage. These mutations accumulate in the organism and could become a precursor for malignancies. Thus, study of these mutations can shed light on prognosis and possible treatment of the disease. Single cell sequencing has been shown to be better at detecting somatic mosaicism compared to bulk sequencing. However, due to the scares amount of DNA in a single cell, an amplification process is required. There are two type of amplifications, clonal expansion: where a single cell is cultured to produce a colony, which provides enough DNA for sequencing and; MDA (Multiple Displacement Amplification) where the DNA is amplified using PCR-like methods. Different amplification methods have their pros and cons and also introduces specific artifacts.</p><p>We are working on strategies for distinguishing signal from noise that might be introduced during cell culture or DNA amplification. Applying these methods, we are able to distinguish properly amplified good cells from bad cells with multiple artifacts introduced due to various reasons. We are also constantly trying to understand the origin of these biases in order to address them better.</p><p>With the advent of next generation sequencing, single cell genomics provides new perspective to the understanding of genetics by studying genomes at cellular level.

Cancer genomics;<p>Over the past decade, high throughput next generation technologies coupled with computational algorithms have enabled us to better understand the biology of cancer as well as the molecular underpinnings of its development and progression. Numerous functionally significant point mutations as well as structural alterations have been identified in several types and sub-types of cancers, illustrating the diverse landscape of the cancer genome. In our lab, we focus on the discovery and analysis of somatic point mutations and structural alterations including deletions, duplications and copy number changes in colon cancer and glioma. Specifically, we are interested in understanding the relationship between patterns of genetic alterations and modes of evolution of the cancer, as well as molecular differences between a cancer-free and cancer adjacent polyp.</p>;polyp2.png
CNV and CNA analysis;<p>Copy number variation (CNV) in the genome is a complex phenomenon, and not completely understood. Somatic copy number alterations (CNA) are frequent in cancers and have been related to cancer susceptibility, cancer progression and invasiveness, individual response to the treatment and patientsâ€™ quality life after treatment. Detection of CNVs and CNAs is important to address large spectrum of clinical and scientific questions. Research in our laboratory is focused on the discovery and analysis of genomic variants and their relevance to diseases. We have developed and constantly improving a method, CNVnator, for CNV discovery and genotyping from read-depth (RD) analysis of personal genome sequencing. Our method is based on combining the mean-shift approach used in machine learning with additional refinements. C++ implementation of CNVnator is freely available in laboratory github page</p>;cnvnator.png
Variant function;<p>Simultaneous advances in the areas of genomics (variant discovery), epigenomics and functional genomics (ChiP-seq, ATAC-seq, Hi-C, RNA-seq) provide an opportunity to study both origin and consequence of a genomic variant. We are interested in understanding various epigenomic properties that predispose mutational processes generating single nucleotide variation (SNV) and structural variation (SV). Inversely, germline and somatic variants affect genome function. As many of these variants are present in non-coding regions of genome, their effect is not well understood. Our lab is actively working on this direction with a particular focus on variants contributing toward neuro-developmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorders and Tourette syndrome.</p>;function.png
